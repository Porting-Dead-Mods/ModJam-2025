## Installing Upgrades

### Step 1: Open the Machine GUI

Right-click on a machine (Compressor or Planet Simulator) to open its interface.

### Step 2: Place the Upgrade

Find the upgrade slot in the machine's GUI and place your upgrade item there.

### Step 3: Enjoy the Benefits

The machine will immediately apply the upgrade effects to all operations.

## Upgrade Stacking

You can install multiple upgrades on a single machine. Effects stack:

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="modjam:upgrade_energy" />
  <ItemIcon id="modjam:upgrade_speed" />
  <ItemIcon id="modjam:upgrade_luck" />
</ItemGrid>

**Example:** 2 Speed Upgrades + 1 Energy Upgrade = 20% faster, 10% energy reduction (net +5% energy)

## Advanced Tips

- Energy upgrades can offset the energy cost of Speed and Luck upgrades
- Luck upgrades are most useful for Planet Simulator recipes with bonus outputs
