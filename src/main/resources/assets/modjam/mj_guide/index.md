# Welcome to ModJam

Welcome to the **ModJam** guidebook! This guide will walk you through planetary exploration, space missions, and resource automation.

## What is ModJam?

ModJam is a tech mod focused on **space missions and planetary resource collection**. Build the Planet Simulator multiblock to:

- **Run space missions** to distant planets
